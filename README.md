# MakeAFolderFilesList

 This iterates through a folder, and performs the following actions on its contents:
 
	1) if element is a folder, write it down in the list and iterate through it as well

	2) if element is a file, write it down in the list 

**Arguments-**
The First argument is the folder, 

The second argument is the textfile where to write the list of files.

Both arguments need to be fullpath for the script to work






**Extra Work--**
What makes a list a list is **neatness**. The final product of this script is not neat. 
So, you might want to open your file in Visual Studio Code, Word or any TextEditor where you can search for files and trim the files path to just their name. 

This could require another script but I am stoping here for today. My lazy self is quite content with the end result and extra 2-seconds formatting.



Cheers!!!
